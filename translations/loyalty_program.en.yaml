heading: How to get your SportShop loyalty card?
textSection: You can create a loyalty card only after you have become our user.
             So you need to be registered first, then visit your account settings
             where the option to create a SportShop loyalty card will be offered. By creating a card
             you can earn benefits by collecting points. You can collect with every purchase
             a certain number of points, depending on the total cost of purchasing the item. For every
             100kn spent, you get 10 points on your card (if you created it before). The same points,
             when collecting items from the cart, you can use in a way to reduce the total amount
             for the amount of points collected. You can also delete your loyalty card very easily
             in the account settings.
